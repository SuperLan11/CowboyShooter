Case Conventions
• functions are PascalCase
• classes are PascalCase
• folders are PascalCase
• assets are in PascalCase
• sorting/collision layers are PascalCase
• non-const class variables are camelCase
• function parameters are in camelCase
• const class variables are UPPERCASE or UPPERCASE_UNDERSCORE
• tags are UPPERCASE or UPPERCASE_UNDERSCORE

Other Coding Conventions
• always include the access modifier for variables and functions (private, public, etc)
• group class variables by functionality (ex: group all movement-related variables together, all attack-related variables together, etc.
• do not use the word Script in any script name (for conciseness)
• new line curly braces
• keep Start() as first function in class
• keep Update() as last function in class
• prefab variables have prefab in the name. ex: lassoPrefab
• sound effect audio sources have sfx in the name. ex: hookSfx
